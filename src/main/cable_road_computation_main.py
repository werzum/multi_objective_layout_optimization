    """Compute which lines can be made from road_points to anchor_trees without having an angle greater than max_main_line_slope_deviation
    First, we generate all possible lines between  each point along the road and all head anchors.
    For those which do not deviate more than max_main_line_slope_deviation degrees from the slope line, we compute head anchor support trees along the lines.
    If those are present, we compute triples of tail anchor support trees.
    If those are present, valid configurations are appended to the respective lists.
